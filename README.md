### Python Meetup / 9.9.
### Speaker: Franko Buneta, Data Scientist, IBM

Title: Beyond the Bamboo Forest: Pandas for the Brave and the Curious

In this session, we‚Äôll go beyond the basics of Pandas, the most popular and widely used data science library in Python. We will dive into techniques that experienced Python data scientists can immediately apply to their daily workflows, data pipelines, and exploratory data analysis.

The focus will be on:

Helpful Custom Methods in Pandas
‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Extending the pandas API with custom accessors and methods
‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Reusable patterns for common transformations
‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Chaining custom methods to create cleaner, more readable pipelines
Data Lineage Using Pandas and Mermaid
‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Tracking the history of transformations applied to a dataset
‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Annotating DataFrames with metadata for auditability
‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Simple and effective strategies to preserve lineage without leaving your Jupyter Notebook
Filtering and Updating Data with Complex Criteria
‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Combining multiple conditions efficiently with boolean masks
‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Conditional updates with .loc
‚Ä¢‚Å† ‚Å†Handling advanced use cases such as nested logic, cross-column checks, and conditional replacements
By the end of the lecture, you‚Äôll have a set of concrete techniques to make your pandas workflows more powerful, transparent, and efficient.

Audience:
This talk is primarily designed for experienced Python developers and data scientists who already use pandas and want to refine their toolkit with advanced patterns.
